I am strong.
I am determined.
I can become a web developer.


I will invest 6-8 hrs every single day.

Paragraph: <p>I can <em>write</em> a <i>paragraph</i> in website.</p>

<p>I will watch videos, practice modules, and if I got stuck, I will ask for help and I will <strong>never give up</strong> to <b>learn</b> and
    I am <p>serious</p> to work hard to become a web developer and crack a job or intern. I know this is possible but not easy.
