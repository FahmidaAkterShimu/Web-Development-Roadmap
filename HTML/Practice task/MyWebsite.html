            <h4>A Glimpse of History</h4>
            Ahsan Manzil, famously known as the Pink Palace, was once the residence of the Nawabs of Dhaka. The soft
            pink color of the building instantly catches your eye, especially under the bright daylight. As you walk
            through its grand corridors and spacious rooms, you can almost feel the stories of royal life, political
            gatherings, and historical events that shaped the city.
            <br>
            Today, Ahsan Manzil serves as a museum. Inside, you'll find old photographs, furniture, utensils, and
            documents that beautifully showcase the lifestyle of the Nawabs. Each room feels like a chapter from
            history, making the visit both educational and fascinating.

            <h4>The Charm of Old Dhaka</h4>
            One of the best parts of visiting Ahsan Manzil is its location. The surrounding area is full of
            life-narrow streets, colorful rickshaws, busy markets, and the constant sound of people and vendors. The
            Buriganga River nearby adds a special charm, especially during the evening when the sky turns golden.

            <h4>Food You Can't Miss</h4>
            A trip to Ahsan Manzil is incomplete without enjoying Old Dhaka's famous food. Just a short walk away,
            you'll find countless food stalls and traditional restaurants offering mouth-watering dishes.
            <br>

            Some must-try foods include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kacchi Biryani-</strong> rich, flavorful, and perfectly cooked</li>
                <li><strong>Morog Polao-</strong> a classic festive dish</li>
                <li><strong>Borhani-</strong> a refreshing spicy drink</li>
                <li><strong>Bakarkhani & Cha-</strong> perfect for an evening snack</li>
                <li>Old Dhaka <strong>Sweets</strong> like jilapi and faluda</li>
            </ul>
            The aroma of spices in the air makes it impossible to resist trying something new.

            <h4>Best Time to Visit</h4>
            The best time to visit Ahsan Manzil is during the winter months (November to February) when the weather
            is pleasant. Visiting in the afternoon and staying until evening lets you enjoy both the museum and the
            lively atmosphere outside.

            <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
            Ahsan Manzil is more than just a historical building—it's an experience. From learning about Dhaka's
            royal past to enjoying legendary street food, every moment spent here feels special. If you want to
            understand the true essence of Dhaka, this place deserves a spot at the top of your travel list.
